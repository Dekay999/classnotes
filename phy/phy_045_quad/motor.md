BEMF zero cross detection driving is a brushless 3 phase motor driving
method that relies on estimating the rotors position by using voltage
generated by the motor’s rotation. Naturally, brushless motors
generate voltage when rotating similar to how a generator produces
power. This voltage generated by the brushless motor is called
BEMF. During operation, it is possible to view the BEMF signal of a DC
3 phase brushless DC motor on a disconnected phase.

The vast majority of robots today are driven by rotary electric motors
(Fig. 9.1). Large industrial robots typically use brushless servo
motors while small laboratory or hobby robots use brushed DC motors or
stepper motors

How they accurately control axis feed and speed is much easier to
grasp once you understand a simple fact: As their name suggests,
stepper motors don’t rotate in the manner of a traditional
motor. Instead, they step. Steppers make repeated movements of small,
fixed increments, appearing to the naked eye as continuous motor
rotation.
