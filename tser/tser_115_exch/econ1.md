# Exchange Rate

$z(t)$: Current account

$q(t)$: Real exchange rate

$k(t)$: Autonomous capital flows

$r(t)$: Official sales of foreign reserves

$d(t)$: Under normal circumstances, current account imbalances are
financed by “accommodating” capital flows

$c(t)$: International payment flows

We assume that the real exchange rate is the major driving force
behind the trade balance and therefore behind the current account,
$z(t)$. An appreciated real exchange rate leads to a deterioration of
a country's international competitiveness and thus puts a downward
pressure on the trade balance; a weak real exchange rate, on the other
hand, strengthens the trade balance:

$$
\dot{z}(t) = -\phi_1 z(t)  - \phi_2 q(t)
$$

Flows finance existing current account imbalances,

$$
\dot{z}(t) = -\phi_1 z(t)  - \phi_2 q(t)
$$

$$
r(t) = -z(t) - k(t) - d(t)
$$

International payment flows, $c(t)$, are driven by the sum of a
country's current account and its financial balance:

$$
c(t) = -z(t) - k(t) - d(t)
$$
